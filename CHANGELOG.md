# Changelog

All notable changes to `kaos-agents` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **Default-deny destructive tool approvals (KC17-P0-2).** `Runner` and `tool_bridge` previously
  treated `permission_policy=None` as "skip all checks" — meaning an HTTP API or MCP caller could
  invoke a tool annotated `destructiveHint=True` with no approval gate. Now `None` installs
  `PermissionPolicy.default_safe()` which escalates destructive / `humanConfirmationRequired` tools
  to ASK. Tests, internal benchmarks, and other callers that genuinely need to bypass all checks
  must set `Runner(unsafe_bypass=True)` explicitly. Production deployments MUST NOT use the bypass.

### Added
- `research_profile = "strict"` setting (env: `KAOS_AGENT_RESEARCH_PROFILE`)
  for legal / regulated deployments. Raises BM25 score floor, verifier
  confidence threshold, and refuses unverified answers via a typed
  `InsufficientEvidence` collapse instead of warn-and-return. Default profile
  behavior unchanged (KC17-P2-1).
- KaosRuntime VFS isolation: `KaosRuntime(vfs=...)` kwarg + `KaosRuntime.test_mode(in_memory=True)` classmethod
  + `runtime.artifacts` as `cached_property`. Closes the disk-VFS cross-run leakage footgun in live tests.
  Live composition tests are now isolated by default. (Sprint-1 #1, commit d0ba060.)
- Auth/rate-limit/transport failures surface as `isError=True` with credential-named recovery hints
  via `kaos_agents.errors.classify_agent_failure()`. (Sprint-1 #2, commit dee0c9a.) Closes
  skeptic-prod-ops Probe 4b.
- Three-layer OWASP LLM01 defense for `FindingsAgent`: pre-flight heuristic flag, XML isolation
  envelope around all candidate text, defensive signature docstring. Plus live test against Sonnet 4.6
  including a synthesis-targeted payload variant. (Sprint-1 #3, commit fb82f64.) Closes skeptic-prod-ops Probe 1.
- `FindingsRefusal` structured value type with three stable refusal reasons
  (`no_candidates_enumerated`, `no_relevant_candidates`, `budget_exceeded`). Refusal surfaces via
  `FindingsResult.refusal` and `AgentFindingsTool.structuredContent["refusal_reason"]`. (Sprint-1 #4,
  commit 916cb67.) Closes skeptic-trust Probe 2 empty-answer UX bug.
- `FindingsAgent.temperature=0.0` by default; deterministic finding_ids via SHA256(block_ref,
  char_span, normalized_text)[:12]; `runs >= 2` union mode for multi-run consistency. 5-run Jaccard
  rises from 0.84-0.92 (skeptic-trust baseline) to 0.955-1.000 on Anthropic Haiku 4.5. (Sprint-2 #5,
  commit f752ecf.) Closes skeptic-trust Probe 1 (consistency).
- `select_by="semantic"` selector with LLM-driven query rewrite + 8-term sanitized expansion union;
  low-recall warning on token selector when < 5 candidates for >= 6-word question. (Sprint-2 #6, commit
  0ffb020.)
- `FindingsAgent.max_cost_usd` strict wave-level cap (Phase-2 filter + Phase-3 synthesis); honest
  `budget_exceeded` reporting across `AgentChatTool` (soft, 2x overshoot bound), `AgentPlanTool`
  (strict per-step), `AgentFindingsTool` (strict wave-level), `AgentCorpusFilterTool` (post-hoc).
  (Sprint-3 #9, commit 21463ba.) Closes skeptic-prod-ops Probe 2.
- `AgentResponse.cost_usd` + `AgentResponse.total_tokens` as first-class frozen attributes. Same
  numbers ship as `ToolResult.structuredContent["cost_usd"]` and `["total_tokens"]` across all four
  agent tools. (Sprint-3 #10, commit a338d1e.)
- Property-style test asserting the three event→AgentResponse
  drain paths (Runner.turn / agent.py / events_to_response.py)
  produce identical normalized output, closing the unenforced
  "must agree" invariant before consolidation lands in 0.1.0a2
  (KC17-P1-4, PA14).

### Fixed
- Package root re-exports the three pattern classes the README markets but `__init__.py` previously
  hid behind submodules: `FindingsAgent`, `ReflexionLoop`, `RouterAgent` are now importable from
  `kaos_agents` directly. Closes KC17-P0-5.
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_extract_live.py` now carries `pytestmark = pytest.mark.live` so the
  default `pytest -m "not live and not network and not slow"` run no longer spends real Anthropic
  tokens on every CI invocation. Recipe-name assertion bumped from `court-opinion-v1` to
  `court-opinion-v2` to match the shipping recipe schema id. Closes KC17-P2-2.
- sdist no longer ships unredacted telemetry recordings from
  `tests/integration/runs/` or privileged-marker benchmark JSONs
  from `docs/benchmarks/`. The 9 Harvey-Lab raw JSONs (which
  contain LLM-generated deliverable text with "PRIVILEGED AND
  CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION / ATTORNEY WORK
  PRODUCT" boilerplate) moved to a gitignored
  `docs/benchmarks/_private/`; their public pass-rate /
  cost summary remains in
  `harvey-coc-pipeline-comparison-2026-05-06.md`. Multiformat
  benchmark `corpus_dir` paths rewritten to repo-relative. New
  `scripts/check_sdist.py` gate fails any future release that
  regresses; CI release jobs should call it after `uv build`.
  Sdist drops from 17 MB / 752 files to 2.0 MB / 564 files.
  Closes KC17-P0-4.

### Documentation
- Per-file fixture provenance manifests added to every leaf data directory under `tests/fixtures/`:
  `harvey-lab/<task>/`, `harvey-lab/<task>/documents/`, and `images/` now each carry a
  source-URL + license + retrieved + SHA-256 table per file, satisfying
  `docs/oss/50-data-and-fixtures/provenance-policy.md:16`. Closes KC17-P1-5.

### Changed
- Streaming recorder JSONL schema bumped to v3: header line written + fsync'd on `__aenter__`,
  per-invocation lines streamed + fsync'd during run, optional trailer at exit. Audit trail
  now survives SIGTERM and pod eviction. (Sprint-3 #8, commit b8f5998.) Closes skeptic-prod-ops Probe 4c.
- `parse_html` default `pre_content_mode='prose'` (was `'code'`); K3 SentencesWith* tools emit a
  shape-mismatch warning when paragraphs are sparse and `<pre>` blocks dominate. (Sprint-2 #7,
  commit fe73833.) Federal Register / news / Wikipedia / web-search HTML pipelines no longer
  silently produce zero entity hits.
- Bumped `kaos-llm-core>=0.1.0a4` dependency for the `gpt-5.5` pricing entry parity fix (KC16-2).

### Security
- Test capture JSONLs no longer committed to the public repo; `.gitignore` covers
  `tests/integration/runs/*.jsonl`. Production users running the recorder in regulated environments
  MUST point output at encrypted-at-rest storage (KaosVFS with encryption, S3 SSE-KMS, etc.) — see
  README "Known limitations" for the data-plane discussion. (KC16-4.)

### Known Limitations

This is an honest list, not a buried disclaimer. v0.1.0a1 is an alpha;
the items below are tracked work that did not block release but a
regulated-industry adopter must know about.

- **OpenAI reasoning models (gpt-5.5, o3, o4, …) are not supported** for findings-based extraction
  in v0.1.0a1. `FindingsAgent` sends `temperature=0` unconditionally and these models reject it
  with HTTP 400. Cost accounting on gpt-5.5 also reports `$0` despite real billing (pending kaos-llm-core
  0.1.0a4). Use Anthropic Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 4.6 or OpenAI `gpt-5.4-mini` instead. Tracked as PA16
  for v0.1.0a2. (KC16-2, KC16-3.)
- **Chat-path cost cap is honest but soft.** `AgentChatTool(max_cost_usd=X)` may overshoot the cap
  by up to 2x in a single turn (one classify + one ReAct iteration). `budget_exceeded` flag is
  truthful. For strict per-call caps use `kaos-agent-findings` (wave-level) or `kaos-agent-plan`
  (per-step). Tracked as PA13 for v0.1.0a2. (KC16-6.)
- **`ResearchAgent` / RAG path has no cost cap.** Tracked as PA11 for v0.1.0a2. (KC16-5.)
- **Findings consistency on `openai:gpt-5.4-mini` is ~0.75 Jaccard** (vs the 0.95 Anthropic floor).
  Two associates running the same query may see materially different surviving sets. Use the
  `runs >= 2` union mode on this provider for audit-grade work. (KC16-7.)
- **`anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` consistency typically holds at 0.92-0.96** but PA15 observed one
  0.621 outlier across three runs. Anthropic does not advertise `temperature=0` as bit-deterministic.
  For audit-grade extraction prefer Haiku or use `runs >= 2`. (KC16-12.)
- **Cross-provider coverage in v0.1.0a1 is limited to 3 verified rows.** Anthropic Haiku 4.5,
  Anthropic Sonnet 4.6, OpenAI gpt-5.4-mini — all green. OpenAI gpt-5.5 — RED (see above). Google,
  xAI, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter — UNVERIFIED for v0.1.0a1 against the Sprint 1-3 contracts.
  Tracked as PA15 follow-ups. (KC16-15.)
- **Audit-trail JSONL captures persist full document bodies, conversation context, and
  agent-generated content** to disk. In regulated deployments (SOC2 / HIPAA / FINRA / GLBA) these
  files are subject to the same retention, encryption-at-rest, and access-control requirements as
  the source documents themselves. The recorder writes to a `Path` you supply — do NOT point it at
  unencrypted disk in production. The recorder also only captures calls routed through
  `kaos-llm-core`; direct provider SDK calls in user-supplied tools are invisible to the trail.
  (KC16-4, KC16-13.)
- **Persistence model: disk-first by default.** `KaosRuntime()` uses a disk-backed VFS rooted at
  `.kaos-vfs/`. Session memory persists across container restarts. For stateless / per-request
  deployments use `KaosRuntime.test_mode()` (in-memory + `IsolationMode.GLOBAL`). For multi-tenant
  deployments, scope the VFS root per-tenant. (KC16-21.)
- **`FindingsAgent.max_chunks` / `max_candidates` ceilings** were added in v0.1.0a1 to defend
  against accidental `select_by='every_sentence'` calls on giant corpora (default 200 chunks, 5000
  candidates). The cost cap is the primary defense; these are belt-and-suspenders. Lift them
  explicitly when you have a known-bounded large-corpus job. (KC16-9.)
- **K5 summary-aware triage and raw BM25 are different rankers, not equivalents.** At n>=16 docs
  they share <70% of their top-5 results; at n=64 they share ~10%. Treat K5 as a complementary
  signal, not a drop-in BM25 replacement. (KC16-14.)

### Removed
- `License :: ...` Trove classifier (PEP 639 supersedes; `license = "Apache-2.0"` is now the
  canonical declaration).
